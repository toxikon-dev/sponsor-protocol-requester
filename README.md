Toxikon Sponsor Protocol Request portal
.NET MVC application 

cts.toxikon.com/SPR (currently down)

The sponsor protocol request system was going to be a client facing project that would allow sponsors to request protocols (similar to TPM) through a web portal.  

There would be a toxikon user role that would be able to approve or reject these requests, but it would save some time for communicating protocol needs. 

Project was halted due to product owner unresponsiveness.  It was also going to take some time to validate a client facing application that needed secure user authentification and autorization systems while also accessing our TPM database.
